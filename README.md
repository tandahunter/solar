# Solar

A project started in Go, to learn about Go, that is quickly turning into an HTML project to learn about THREE.js.

## Function

A simple web-server that provides a basic REST API to some made-up real-time planetary data.  The application also provides a web socket that streams planetary data for rendering purposes.

## Getting Started

(TODO)
go get etc
dependencies
go run solar.go
http://localhost:8080/rest api / index.3d.html / index.2d.html etc
